Rules:
- businessPurpose: one sentence, business domain language, not code language
- parameters: use LINKAGE SECTION VARIABLES — field names, PIC types, and direction labels [in]/[out] are pre-analyzed; infer JS type: PIC X = string, PIC 9 = number, group level (no PIC) = object; direction null means infer from context
- entryPoints: use ENTRY POINT DISPATCH as the starting point — each WHEN entry is one entry point; if ENTRY POINT DISPATCH is (none), look for EVALUATE or IF blocks dispatching on a linkage parameter; if no dispatch create one entry with condition "always"
- entryPoints[].paragraphNames: list ALL paragraph names relevant to this entry point including PRE-DISPATCH PARAGRAPHS (for large-file second-pass use)
- entryPoints[].steps: include PRE-DISPATCH PARAGRAPHS logic first (validation, access checks, initial setup) — these run before every mode; then mode-specific steps; describe WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE BUSINESS, not code mechanics
- entryPoints[].sideEffects: every data change, record creation/update/deletion, counter change, external call triggered
- errorCatalog: use ERROR ENTRIES as the canonical list — each entry has seqNo and dataElement pre-extracted; populate code=seqNo, add businessMeaning and systemAction from context; include every entry listed
- externalDependencies: only CALLS representing meaningful business operations; EXCLUDE calls starting with C_ (C_WRITELNKAREA, C_GETPLENV, C_GETDATETM, C_HIGHLOW, C_ISOLATION, C_COMPRESS) — middleware boilerplate
- dbTables: combine DATABASE OPERATIONS (EXEC SQL) and DATABASE OPERATIONS (TUX MIDDLEWARE); if you see PREFIX2 operating on the same table as PREFIX in the paragraph text, that is a second buffer for the same table (not a different table) — the parser already deduplicates these; return [] if none
- fileIO: file I/O from FILE I/O (SELECT statements) and OPEN/READ/WRITE/CLOSE in paragraphs; return [] if none

Analysis discipline (from CAPI_RULES.md):
- Paragraph names are labels, not contracts — do NOT infer behavior from the name alone (VALIDATE-ACCESS in one program checks branches, in another it reads entirely different tables); always base analysis on the actual code content of each paragraph provided
- For each table read found in paragraphs, consider what happens after: are there conditional errors (not found = error?), fallback reads with different keys, or field derivation from the result?
- The pre-dispatch paragraphs listed in PRE-DISPATCH PARAGRAPHS run before every mode — their validation and setup logic applies to ALL entry points

export const ANALYZE_ENTRY_POINT_PROMPT = (condition, businessName, context) => `
You are a COBOL expert analyzing one specific operation of a legacy program for JavaScript rewrite documentation.

Operation: ${businessName} (triggered when ${condition})

${context}

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema exactly:
{
  "steps": ["ordered business action 1", "ordered business action 2"],
  "sideEffects": ["what changes in the system: inserts into TABLE-X", "increments COUNTER-Y"],
  "returns": "what is set or returned on success",
  "errors": ["ERROR-CODE-OR-CONDITION: business meaning and consequence"]
}

Rules:
- steps: start with PRE-DISPATCH PARAGRAPHS logic (validation, access, setup listed in context) — these run before this operation too; then describe the operation-specific WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE BUSINESS, not code mechanics
- sideEffects: every data change, record creation/update/deletion, counter change, external call triggered
- returns: what output parameters or status values are set on success
- errors: reference ERROR ENTRIES from context — format as "seqNo (dataElement): business meaning"; use actual seq numbers from the list, not generic descriptions
- Paragraph names are labels: do NOT infer behavior from name alone — base analysis on actual paragraph code provided
- For table reads: describe what happens after (conditional errors, fallback reads, field derivation)
